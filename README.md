# CTF Challenge: Base64 & Caesar Cipher

# Description:
This CTF challenge involves a message that has been encoded using both Base64 and the Caesar cipher. Participants need to decode the message to reveal the hidden flag.

# Objective:
The objective of this challenge is to demonstrate understanding and proficiency in decoding messages encrypted with Base64 and the Caesar cipher.

# Challenge Steps
# 1. Base64 Encoding: 
The message is initially encoded using Base64. Participants must decode the Base64-encoded message to reveal an intermediate message.

# 2. Caesar Cipher Encryption: 
The Base64-decoded message is then further encrypted using the Caesar cipher with a specific shift value. Participants must decrypt the Caesar cipher-encoded message to reveal the final message.

# 3. Flag: 
The final decoded message contains the flag in the format CTF{best_crypto_flag}. Participants must extract the flag from the decoded message.

# Usage
1. Run the provided Python script (Flag_Challenge.py).
2. Follow the instructions printed in the console to see the encoded and decoded messages at each step of the challenge.

# Requirements
Python 3.x

# Files
ctf_challenge.py: Python script containing the challenge code.

# Getting Started
1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python installed.
3. Run the Python script to see the encoded and decoded messages.

# Example Output
Encoded Message: SGVyZSB3ZSBhcmUsIHRha2UgdGhpcyBmbGFnIENURntiZXN0X2N5cHRvX2ZsYWd9
Encoded message using Caesar cipher: VJYbCVE3CVEkfpXvLKUkd2XjgJksfbEpeJIqLHQXUqwlCAQ0A2Q5fKUyA2CvBZg9
Decoded message using Caesar cipher: Here we are, take this flag CTF{best_cypto_flag}
Decoded Message: Here we are, take this flag CTF{best_cypto_flag}
