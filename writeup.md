Author: [goelmedha1] (https://github.com/goelmedha1/CTF)

## Description

Cryptography Challenge:
Objective: Decrypt hidden messages using cryptography techniques.
Part 1: Recognize an image of Julius Caesar and decrypt a base64 and Caesar Cypher-encoded message related to him.
Part 2: Decrypt a second message using base64.
Completion: Participants receive a congratulatory message and the flag upon successful decryption.

### Why Cryptography?
Cryptography is an essential field in computer science and cybersecurity. It involves encoding and decoding messages to secure data transmission and protect sensitive information. By creating challenges on cryptography, we aim to:

1. Enhance problem-solving skills: Cryptography challenges require logical thinking and analytical skills to decrypt hidden messages.
2. Foster interest in cybersecurity: Engaging challenges encourage participants to explore cybersecurity concepts and learn about encryption techniques.
3. Promote learning: Participants gain hands-on experience in applying cryptographic methods, increasing their knowledge and understanding of cybersecurity principles.

### Types of Challenges
Our cryptography challenge comprises two parts:

1. Image Recognition and Decryption: Participants analyze an image of Julius Caesar and decrypt a base64-encoded message related to him. This challenge tests participants' ability to recognize historical figures and apply basic cryptography techniques.
2. Text Decryption: Participants decrypt a second message using secret computer languages. This challenge challenges participants to decipher hidden messages encoded in various encryption schemes, showcasing their proficiency in cryptography.
